# CF-KOI
KOI Web Application for CauseForce.com's internal reporting tool.

# Deployment

Run `npm run build` to build the app before deployment, this ensures all current changes are brought into the final app build.

Run `npm run build —watch` to build “on the go” and watch for any changes. (efficient when writing code and constantly deploying)

Run `npm start` to start the server, which then runs calls to our API end-points and appends latest data into MongoDB. (this must be running in order to use the app).
